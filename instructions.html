        <p>Minesweeper is a game, played on a grid of squares. There are two types of squares, squares that contain mines and squares that don't. Goal of the game is to flag all the mines on the board as fast as possible.</p>
        <h3 id="title2">How to play:</h3>
        <p> To begin the game you need to click on one of the squares. If the square doesn't have mines, it will be empty or there will be a number on the square (from 1 to 8), to tell you how many mines is the numbered square touching (corners also count). <br>This labeling will be helpful to locate and flag all the mines (number of flags left or mines on board is written in the top left corner of this game).
            To also make things easier for you, each time you click on a square without mines, each square connected to it (in each size up to numbered squares) will also open up. <br>To win a game, you are required to successfully click all the squares, without hitting a mine and also label all the mines correctly. Keep in mind there is also a timer, which will start when you first click on any square in a game and will stop when you have won or hit a mine.</p>
